# Duplicate Consolidation Plan

## Target Families
1. prometheus.yml (13 copies) -> consolidate into shared/shared_scripts/nginx/templates/monitoring/prometheus.yml
2. health-check scripts (health-check.sh, service-health-check.sh) (multiple families) -> move to shared/shared_scripts/actions/health/
3. docker-compose override variants -> will be replaced by central compose in Phase 3
4. Egg-info text metadata (dependency_links.txt, entry_points.txt, top_level.txt) -> remove (re-generated by build)
5. Repeated rust lib.rs / risk.rs in per-service shared_rust -> prefer single canonical crate (Phase 3 Rust refactor)

## Steps
- Phase A (now): inventory & mark canonical paths.
- Phase B: create mapping file duplicate_mapping.tsv (original -> canonical).
- Phase C: script to move (trash originals, symlink or reference).
